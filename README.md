   - Or from another device on the same network: `http://<your-phone-ip>:5000`

## Usage

### Adding a Playlist

1. Copy a YouTube Music playlist URL
   - Example: `https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
2. Paste it in the "Add New Playlist" field
3. Click "Add" - the playlist will be fetched and added to your list
4. The system will automatically detect songs already downloaded

### Managing Playlists

- **Rename**: Click the edit (pencil) icon
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon
- **Sync Individual**: Click the refresh icon on a playlist
- **Sync All**: Click "Sync All" button in the header

### Settings

Click the "Settings" button to configure:
- **Output Directory**: Where to save downloaded music
  - Windows: `C:\Music\Downloads`
  - Termux: `/storage/emulated/0/Music/Downloads`
- **Bitrate**: Audio quality (128, 192, 256, 320 kbps)
- **Sync Interval**: How often to auto-sync (in minutes)
- **Auto-Sync**: Enable/disable automatic synchronization

### Understanding Progress

Each playlist shows:
- **Song Counter**: `23/50` means 23 downloaded out of 50 total
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of completion percentage
- **Current Song**: Name of the song currently being downloaded
- **Status**: Real-time updates in the activity log

### Activity Log

The right sidebar shows recent activity:
- Playlist additions
- Download progress
- Completion notifications
- Errors (if any)

## How It Works

### Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with three main tables:

1. **playlists**: Stores playlist information
2. **songs**: Stores unique songs with video IDs
3. **playlist_songs**: Many-to-many relationship (songs can be in multiple playlists)

### Smart Deduplication

When you add a playlist:
1. System fetches all songs from the playlist
2. Compares each song's video ID with the database
3. If song exists and is downloaded ‚Üí counts toward completion
4. If song exists but not downloaded ‚Üí queued for download
5. If song is new ‚Üí added to database and queued

This means if Song A is in Playlist 1 and Playlist 2:
- It only downloads once
- Both playlists show it as downloaded
- Storage is optimized

### Sync Process

**Global Sync**: Downloads all missing songs from all playlists
**Playlist Sync**: Downloads only missing songs from that specific playlist

The sync process:
1. Queries database for songs marked as "not downloaded"
2. Uses yt-dlp to download each song
3. Converts to MP3 with specified bitrate
4. Updates database when complete
5. Shows real-time progress

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues

**"FFmpeg not found"**
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to PATH
- Restart command prompt after adding to PATH

**"Module not found" errors**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Permission errors**
- Run as administrator if saving to system directories
- Or change output directory to user folder

### Termux Issues

**"Permission denied" for storage**
- Run `termux-setup-storage` again
- Grant storage permission in Android settings

**"Cannot connect to server"**
- Check if Python is running without errors
- Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead

**Download failures**
- Ensure you have stable internet connection
- Check if cookies.txt is needed for age-restricted content
- Update yt-dlp: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`

### General Issues

**Playlist not loading**
- Verify the URL is correct (YouTube Music, not regular YouTube)
- Check internet connection
- Try adding cookies.txt for authentication

**Songs not downloading**
- Check output directory exists and is writable
- Verify FFmpeg is working: `ffmpeg -version`
- Check activity log for specific errors

**Database errors**
- Delete `data/playlists.db` and restart (will reset all data)
- Ensure data directory has write permissions

## Advanced Configuration

### Cookies for Authentication

Some playlists or songs may require authentication. To add cookies:

1. Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt"
2. Log into YouTube Music
3. Export cookies for `music.youtube.com`
4. Save as `data/cookies.txt`
5. Restart the application

### Custom Output Templates

Edit the `get_ydl_opts` function in `app.py`:

```python
'outtmpl': os.path.join(output_dir, '%(title)s - %(artist)s.%(ext)s'),
```

Change to your preferred format:
- `'%(title)s.%(ext)s'` - Title only
- `'%(artist)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s'` - Artist folders
- `'%(playlist)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s'` - Playlist folders

### Running as a Service

**Windows**: Use NSSM or Task Scheduler
**Termux**: Use Termux:Boot app
